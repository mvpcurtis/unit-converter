# Unit Converter

## Description

Credit to Scrimba.com for the project idea.

This is one of the solo projects that I was tasked with by Scrimba to develop my JavaScript skills via their 'Learn JavaScript' course.

This project takes in a value (number) from the input field and when the 'convert' button is pressed, the results are passed into the their relevant sections on the DOM. If the value is not a number, then an error message will pop up and inform the user.

This project converts units between 'metric' and the 'imperial' systems. For example, is you entered '20' as a value and pressed the convert button, the project would convert tell you what 20 meters in feet is and also vice versa (20 feet in meters).
